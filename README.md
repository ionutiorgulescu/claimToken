This is a demo for a `Portal` component.

The `Portal` can mount to a node passed as a prop or, if the prop is not passed, it will create a new node, append it to the body and remove it when the component unmounts.

To run, install dependencies, `npm install`, and run wds, `npm run start`. `yarn` is also setup.
